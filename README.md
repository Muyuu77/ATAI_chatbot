‚ùóVERY IMPORTANT: to fully operate the agent or test it, there are still some steps that need to be followed to download the data needed.

## üïëUpdates

### 11.21 Evaluation3 Update
Re-structurize the whole demo, now we have separate modules to handle different functions: 
- closed question/open question
- recommendation
- crowdsource

**Common Modules**

`LM.py`: module for language process. Contains various language models.

`KG_handler.py`: module for knowledge graph. Store all member variables relevant to the KG. Each variable relevant to the KG (e.g. rel2lbl, ent2lbl, rel_emb, etc.) should be grabbed from this module and from the class with the same name as the module file (e.g. KG_handler)

`demo.py`: module for the main body of our bot. The main function is to handle various modules and assemble them as a real bot. 

**Functional Modules**

`Recommendor.py`: module specially designed for handling recommendation questions. outer API: `.recommend(sentence, mode)`. The mode argument is supposed to be within ["feature", "movie"]. To be more specific, *"feature"* means return common features of given movies. While *"movie"* mean recommending a movie directly based on graph embedding

`Que.py`: module for natural language query. **Haven't finished yet**

`CrowdSource.py`: module for crowdsource task. **Haven't finished yet**
